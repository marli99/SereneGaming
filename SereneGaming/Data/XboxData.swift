    Xbox(name: "First Generation: Xbox",date: "2001 - 2009", Image: "16-years-ago-today-xbox-was-forced-to-recall-millions-of-power-cords.900x", price: "R2 000", description: "The first generation Xbox was actually the sixth generation of consoles, competing with other sixth-generation consoles like the Sega Dreamcast, Sony PlayStation 2, and Nintendo GameCube. The first generation Xbox sold roughly 24 million consoles which was unfortunately still heavily outsold by its competitor Sony with their PlayStation 2 which sold over 155 million consoles in its lifetime. The PlayStation 2 is also currently still the number 1 best-selling console worldwide. Nintendo’s GameCube sold almost as many consoles as the Xbox but still fell short with approximately 22 million console sales. Unfortunately, Sega’s Dreamcast only sold approximately 9.1 million consoles and ranked last in sales."),
Xbox(name: "Second Generation: Xbox 360",date: "2005 - 2016", Image: "Microsoft-releases-new-update-for-Xbox-360-console", price: "R1500", description: "The PlayStation 3 only slightly outsold the Xbox 360 with 87.4 million consoles sold versus Xbox 360s 84 million consoles sold. The best-selling Xbox 360 game is Kinect Adventures! with 24 million copies sold. However, Kinect Adventures’ sales are closely followed by Grand Theft Auto V which sold approximately 23 million copies worldwide on Xbox 360. Third, Fourth, and Fifth positions are dominated by the Call of Duty franchise with Modern Warfare 3 taking third place, Black Ops at fourth, and Black Ops II as the fifth best-selling game on the Xbox 360. Additionally, Retail buyers could choose between 2 configurations – the Xbox 360 Pro (Premium) and Core (Arcade) models. Later a black Xbox 360 was released which was named the Xbox 360 Elite featuring minor upgrades."),
Xbox(name: "Xbox 360 S",date: "2010", Image: "360S", price: "R2 000", description: "Originally released in 2010, the Xbox 360 S was discontinued just before the release of the newer gen console – The Xbox One S. Buyers of the Xbox 360 S could also benefit from backward compatibility on a select few games from the original Xbox. At the time, backward compatibility was one of the most requested features for all consoles as users wanted to replay their older games as well.

    Xbox(name: "Xbox 360 E",date: "2013", Image: "hphjhhjhg", price: "R27 000", description: "The Xbox 360 E (not to be confused with Elite configuration) was released the moment it was announced back in 2013. Lastly only 3 years, the Xbox 360 E featured a similar design to the newer generation Xbox One. When it comes to the internal hardware, the Xbox 360 E was very similar to the Slim model so the Xbox 360 E was mainly designed and sold to showcase a new casing in a two-tone black color. Xbox 360 E Technical Specifications: Colors: Two-tone Black. Manufacturer: Flextronics, Wistron, Celestica, Foxconn. CPU: 3 Core PowerPC Tri-Core Xenon, GPU: Xenos Corona Crayola 6, Memory: 512 MB GDDR3 RAM, Hard Drive: 4GB (Onboard), 250GB. Media: CD, DVD, Digital, HD-DVD.

    Xbox(name: "Third Generation Xbox One",date: "2013 - 2020", Image: "evetech", price: "R7 500", description: "The Third Generation Xbox is called the Xbox One. Initially, when the Xbox One came out, it shipped with or without Kinect. Users who wanted the Kinect features would pay $499 for their console at launch. Users who did not want Kinect would only pay $399 for their Xbox One. The original Xbox One had an incredibly short lifespan. The Xbox One released on November 13, 2013, the original Xbox was discontinued just less than 3 years later. This was due to the release of the Xbox One S. Sales-wise, the Xbox One lacked behind its main competitor Sony and their PlayStation 4. Overall all Xbox One models (original Xbox One, S, and X) sold approximately 48.69 million consoles whilst the PlayStation 4 managed to sell almost 115 million consoles to date. One of the main reasons for this massive gap is that when the PlayStation 4 was released, Sony launched their console at a loss and sold the PlayStation 4 $100 cheaper than the Xbox One."),
    Xbox(name: "Xbox One S",date: "2016", Image: "P_setting_xxx_0_90_end_692", price: "10 000", description: "The Xbox One S was released in 2 versions, a regular Xbox One S, and an All-Digital Xbox One S. The All-Digital version was discontinued on June 16, 2020, just a year after its launch. The regular Xbox One S is still being produced and can still be purchased by clicking the link above. The major differences between the Xbox One and the Xbox One S are the design, as well as the ability to play UHD Blu-Ray. Other differences include the ability to play at 4K resolution (60FPS), the Xbox One S also features an HDMI 2.0 port and a better GPU. Besides Robot White, you could also buy the Xbox One S in Deep Blue. The Deep Blue color was a Gear of War 4 special edition variation."),
    Xbox(name: "Xbox One X", date: "2017", Image: "xbox360X", price: "R14 000", description: "Project Scorpio, later revealed to the Xbox One X launched with better hardware and an all-new design. Unfortunately, the Xbox One X only shipped for 3 years before being discontinued shortly before the release of the next-generation Xbox Series X/S. The Xbox One X came in Matte Black or a Robot White color. However, for a limited time, when the Xbox One X came out, buyers could get their hands on a pre-order limited ‘Project Scorpio Edition’ Xbox One X, with a dark-gradient finish and a green ‘Project Scorpio’ inscription. Some backward compatible games were marketed as ‘Xbox One X Enhanced’ which had a console-specific patch/update when played on an Xbox One X. Xbox One X Enhanced games would often have better graphics, higher framerates, higher resolutions (up to 4K), additional visual effects, and Dolby Atmos support. In total 429 games were enhanced for the Xbox One X."),
    Xbox(name: "Xbox Series X", date: "2020 - present", Image: "seriesXpng", price: "R15 000", description: "The Fourth Generation Xbox Series X released at the same time as the Series S in late 2020. If you look at the hardware, the Series X is similar to a prebuilt gaming PC and features some outstanding parts for its price. What stands out though between the X and S is the size as well as the overall design. The newest Xbox console, The Series X, is much larger than the Series S, the Series X also only comes in Black, while the Series S ships in White. Below you can see a comparison between the two. Some Xbox Series X and S exclusive games include Halo: Infinite, Fable, Forza Motorsport, and State of Decay 3, however, all Microsoft confirmed that most exclusives will also launch alongside a PC release. The Xbox Series X can support up to 8K at 60 FPS and 4K up to 120 FPS which is quite incredible for such a cheap console considering the hardware. The Series X and S also have backward compatibility for all Xbox consoles, excluding Kinect games. Due to the pandemic, some Xbox Series X/S games are expected to be delayed. Due to its incredible success, both Series X and S are suffering from stock shortages which are said to last until the end of Q1 2021. If you’re into racing games such as Forza on this platform we just listed the best gaming steering wheels for 2022 which are mostly tailored towards the Xbox series X/S."),
    Xbox(name: "Xbox Series S", date: "2020", Image: "seriesXpng", price: "R15 000", description: "Unlike the Series X, the Series S only supports up to 1440p at 120 FPS. Its low price tag and small exterior mean that Microsoft had to remove features for everything to fit in the casing. The Series S isn’t able to play backward-compatible games that are enhanced for the Xbox One X, however, it still supports backward compatibility for all previous generations. Unlike the Series X, the Series S is also missing an optical disc drive which makes sense as the Series S was designed for travel use. Travelers would prefer to have all their games digital over CDs so it’s easier to take along on their journey. Xbox Series S Technical Specifications: Colors: Robot White, Manufacturer: Flextronics, Foxconn, CPU: 3.6 GHz custom AMD Zen 2 (8 core), GPU: 1550 MHz AMD Custom RDNA 2, Memory: 10 GB GDDR6, Hard Drive: 500GB, Media: Digital, Video Output: HDMI (up to 1440p support), Network: Gigabit Ethernet, Wifi, Audio: 7.1 Surround Sound, Code Name: Lockhart.")
