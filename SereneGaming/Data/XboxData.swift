    Xbox(name: "Third Generation Xbox One",date: "2013 - 2020", Image: "evetech", price: "R7 500", description: "The Third Generation Xbox is called the Xbox One. Initially, when the Xbox One came out, it shipped with or without Kinect. Users who wanted the Kinect features would pay $499 for their console at launch. Users who did not want Kinect would only pay $399 for their Xbox One. The original Xbox One had an incredibly short lifespan. The Xbox One released on November 13, 2013, the original Xbox was discontinued just less than 3 years later. This was due to the release of the Xbox One S. Sales-wise, the Xbox One lacked behind its main competitor Sony and their PlayStation 4. Overall all Xbox One models (original Xbox One, S, and X) sold approximately 48.69 million consoles whilst the PlayStation 4 managed to sell almost 115 million consoles to date. One of the main reasons for this massive gap is that when the PlayStation 4 was released, Sony launched their console at a loss and sold the PlayStation 4 $100 cheaper than the Xbox One."),
