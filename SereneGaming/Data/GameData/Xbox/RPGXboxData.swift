    RPGXbox(name: "Dark Souls: Remastered",Image: "dark_souls_remastered_xbox_one", price: "R900", description: "Dark Souls is an ultra-difficult action/RPG that casts you as an undead warrior, slowly losing their humanity as they face off against the eldritch horrors in the dying fantasy realm of Lodran.

    RPGXbox(name: "Divinity: Original Sin 2",Image: "dep3n2OhsNtMUppZHXLqT2vWn8G2gWnDmtzFHHEWXHE_350x200_1x-0", price: "R800", description: "Turn-based RPGs don’t often offer co-op play, which makes Divinity: Original Sin 2 something special. This long, involved game lets you create your own character and journey through the fantasy realm of Rivellon, fighting off a variety of foes both mundane and magical. What’s interesting is that up to three other players can do exactly the same thing, making Divinity: Original Sin 2 arguably the next-best thing to playing through a tabletop RPG with your friends. Granted, the game is long — at least 50 hours — so you’re all in for a long haul.  But it beats sitting around and arguing over who should run the next D&D game."),
